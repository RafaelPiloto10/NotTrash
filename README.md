# !Trash

## Inspiration & What it does
!Trash (nɒt træʃ) aims to collect data on the amount of recyclable and compostable materials headed to landfills and prevents recyclables from going into the trash by equipping household trash cans with a camera on the underside of the lid to detect and categorize materials being discarded. 
## How we built it
