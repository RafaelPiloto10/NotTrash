# !Trash

## Inspiration & What it does
!Trash (nɒt træʃ) aims to collect data on the amount of recyclable and compostable materials headed to landfills and prevents recyclables from going into the trash by equipping household trash cans with a camera on the underside of the lid to detect and categorize materials being discarded. 
## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, the Global Analytics page embed from default Google Sheets would take 3-5 minutes to update, but we were able to improve this to update upon one page refresh. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned

## What's next for !Trash
!Trash is currently patent pending and we hope that with more time and better resources we can continue to work on it by building prototypes that will more accurately reflect the data we want to display. We believe our product will encourage people to make a positive impact on our environment.
